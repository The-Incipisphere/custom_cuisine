/**<p>
 * This class handles the logic for your mod on dedicated servers.
 * Most of your mod's features, like registration and event handling, should be managed here.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is extended by ClientProxy because both Minecraft clients and dedicated servers share some common code.
 * (Fun fact: Singleplayer is actually just a server running locally on your computer!)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However, <b>do not</b> attempt to perform client-only actions or access client-only classes (e.g. for: rendering, input handling, or sound management) in this class or anything else accessed by this class.
 * Doing so will cause crashes on dedicated servers, as those client-only classes do not exist in the server build.
